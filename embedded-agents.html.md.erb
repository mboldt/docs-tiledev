This topic provides resources for configuring services that use software agents embedded in application containers.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Some service integrations depend on the ability to inject code into application containers. Examples include:

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) agents for monitoring services
- Container-embedded API gateways
- Client-side routers

We refer to these injected components as "container-embedded agents."

[Buildpacks](buildpacks.html) provide a mechanism to inject components into the application container image, and the `.profile.d` directory provides a way to start agents before or alongside the customer application.
